Welcome!
=========================================
This project was proposed to the Power Electronics class at Walla Walla University (ENGR 460). Since we had been studying DC-DC buck/boost
converters our professor Dr. Rob Frohne gave us a cheap 2.5W solar array and tasked us with drawing maximum power from the array using Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT).

With that goal in mind we made sure to figure it all out and do a wunderful doj

This is an example of code::

   import math
   print 'import done'

here is some inline math :math:`\int_3^2 f(x)dx`

Adding images is already really interesting apparently if I add a newline
it makes a new paragraph.
